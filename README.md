course on bootstrap and websites built using the grid system 
brad traversy bootstrap course 

Description
This course will literally take you from knowing nothing about Bootstrap 3 or 4 to learning all of the utilities, components, widgets and grids and building real world themes and websites. You do NOT need to know Bootstrap 3 for this course. Even if you already know Bootstrap 4, skip the learning sections and head right for section 6 to create the simple boiler theme and start the projects. Everything is completely modular!

Custom Bootstrap Sandbox

I have created a completely custom HTML learning environment for the first few sections of this course. Each lecture has an html page associated with it and has a start state. As we move along through the lectures, you code along with me learning all that Bootstrap 4 offers including helpers/utilities, components, widgets, flexbox and more.

5 Real Projects/Themes

We will create 5 real world themes including. These projects are completely open source and you are free to use them anywhere.
